commit 6dfcefa34991ea03a4c606182c5c241a78f21511 (HEAD -> lecture_1, origin/lecture_1)
Author: Yuliya Sharkadiy <ysharkadiy@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Nov 15 00:19:11 2019 +0200

    Added aditional coments to explain commands setvbuf(). The Eclipse console has buffering problems on Windows. Basically, it doesn't flush the streams when a newline is received. (Unlike a normal windows console window). So, was added following functions in the start of the main function.

commit 6dfcefa34991ea03a4c606182c5c241a78f21511
Author: Yuliya Sharkadiy <ysharkadiy@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Nov 15 00:19:11 2019 +0200

    Added aditional coments to explain commands setvbuf(). The Eclipse console has buffering problems on Windows. Basically, it doesn't flush the streams when a newline is received. (Unlike a normal windows console window). So, was added following functions in the start of the main function.

Notes:

Author: Yuliya Sharkadiy <ysharkadiy@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 18 00:27:07 2019 +0200

    Was added typecasting in swap_64 function.
    Was tried a few method of printing uint64_t veriable.
    As Result:
     Ex.1. Swap MSB to LSB in uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t.
     Result 16 = 0xcdab
     Result 32 = 0x4d3c2b1a
     Result 64 = 0X8877665544332211
     Have a good day :)
     Work was finished.
